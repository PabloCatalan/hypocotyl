# hypocotyl
Python and C++ code to run a hypocotyl elongation model in A. thaliana.

Run main_figures.ipynb to get the simulation plots shown in the paper.

Run model_robustness.ipynb to get the supplementary figures related to 

Run hypocotyl_growth_model.ipynb to see how the model calculates and predicts the growth phenotypes of several genotypes.

File simulated_annealing_random.cpp holds the routine used to fit the model to the experimental dataset. 

File heatmaps.cpp generates the data for Figure 6 in the manuscript. 

Files functions_paper.* are header files for both C++ and Python codes. 

File sensitivity_analysis_global.cpp performs a sensitivity analysis of the model.
