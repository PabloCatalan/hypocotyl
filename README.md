# hypocotyl
Python and C++ code to run a hypocotyl elongation model in A. thaliana.

Run paper_plots.py to get the simulation plots shown in the paper.

Run hypocotyl_growth_model.ipynb to see how the model calculates and predicts the growth phenotypes of several genotypes.

The file simulated_annealing.cpp holds the routine used to fit the model to the experimental dataset.
