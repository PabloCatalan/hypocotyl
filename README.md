# hypocotyl
Python and C++ code to run a hypocotyl elongation model in A. thaliana.

Run main_figures.ipynb to get the simulation plots shown in the paper.

Run hypocotyl_growth_model.ipynb to see how the model calculates and predicts the growth phenotypes of several genotypes.

The file simulated_annealing.cpp holds the routine used to fit the model to the experimental dataset. The file heatmaps.cpp generates the data for Figure 6 in the manuscript. Files functions_paper.* are header files for both C++ and Python codes.
